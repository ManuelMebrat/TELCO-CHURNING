### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The telecom industry is uniquely positioned where emotional factors and customer experience significantly influence retention, alongside product offerings. By applying consumer psychology to the Telco Customer Churn Dataset, we can better understand customer behavior and retention drivers.

Conclusions, insights, and recommendations are provided in the following areas:

How to increase loyalty: Identifying the variables that encourage customer retention.

Churn anticipation: Identifying the variables that drive customer churn.

# How to increase loyalty
• What is loyalty?

• Our highest customer density is within the first 12 months, with 2,186 customers out of 7,043. After this period, we observe more stable retention. We define a loyal customer as one who remains beyond this initial 12-month period. Let’s explore customer behavior over time in more detail.

• Out of 1,869 customers who churned, an alarming 55.49% left within the first 12 months. This highlights the critical importance of the early customer experience. **What is making them stay?**


## Relationships

• Customers with dependents or partners tend to perceive a potential loss of stability and security as more significant. According to [prospect theory]([url](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Behavioral_Decision_Theory/Kahneman_Tversky_1979_Prospect_theory.pdf)), the fear of losing benefits or support from their current services may outweigh the perceived gains of switching providers.

In conclusion, customers with family responsibilities show a higher propensity to stay with their current provider, as they value the stability and security it offers.
