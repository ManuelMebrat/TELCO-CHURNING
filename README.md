To understand why this happens, let's dive into this project:

#PROJECT STRUCTURE

•Interactive PowerBI Dashboard: Available for download [here].

•Jupyter Notebook: Python code and libraries [here].

•SQL Queries: For QA testing of the dashboard [here].

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The telecom industry is uniquely positioned where emotional factors and customer experience significantly influence retention, alongside product offerings. By applying consumer psychology to the Anonymus Telco Customer Churn Dataset from IBM Congos, we can better understand customer behavior and retention drivers.

### Conclusions, insights, and recommendations are provided in the following areas:

**How to increase loyalty:** Identifying the variables that encourage customer retention.

Churn anticipation: Identifying the variables that drive customer churn.

Out of 1,869 customers who churned, an alarming 55.49% left within the first 12 months. This underscores the critical importance of early customer experience, prompting two key questions:

**1. What is driving customers to stay?
2. What is causing them to leave?**

# 1. What is driving customers to stay?

### • A Loyal customer

• Our highest customer density is within the first 12 months, with 2,186 customers out of 7,043. After this period, we observe more stable retention. We define a loyal customer as one who remains beyond this initial 12-month period. Let’s explore customer behavior over time in more detail.

## 1. Relationships

• Customers with dependents or partners tend to perceive a potential loss of stability and security as more significant. According to [Prospect theory,](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Behavioral_Decision_Theory/Kahneman_Tversky_1979_Prospect_theory.pdf) the fear of losing benefits or support from their current services may outweigh the perceived gains of switching providers. Having a partner can reduce the churn rate from 33% to 19%,and a dependant from 31% to just 15%. 

In conclusion, customers with family responsibilities show a higher propensity to stay with their current provider, as they value the stability and security it offers. 

However we can't directly control this variable, so what can we control to make they stay?

## 2. Extra ~~services~~ Value

In a telco company, extra services refer to additional features or options offered to customers beyond basic services like internet, phonelines and multiple lines. For this company  the extra services are Only security, Online backup, Device protection, and Tech support.

Understaing the cost of oportunity of diference churn rate between having or not this extra services, will give us an image of how much or company is losing by not engagig our customer with this services:

Extra services play a crucial role in reducing churn rates for telco companies. By bundling these additional features, the perceived value of the service increases, and customers are more hesitant to switch providers. Contributing to customer retention:

• Increased Perceived Value: Extra services enhance the overall package, making it harder for customers to find equivalent value elsewhere.

• Loss Aversion: Customers fear losing added protections (security, backup), making them less likely to switch providers.

• Customer Inertia: A comprehensive service package creates a barrier to leaving, as switching feels more complex and risky.

# **So how to increase Loyalty?**

**Personalized Support:** 

Implementing tailored support for customers with family. By understanding their need for stability and security, personalized offers or family bundles could resonate strongly with these segments.

**Loyalty Programs:** 

Creating a rewards or loyalty program that builds value over time would encourage longer-term relationships. For instance, customers could earn points for maintaining their service or using extra services, redeemable for discounts or upgrades.

**Flexible Bundles:** 

Creating flexible service bundles that offer customers more control over choosing extra services like security or backup could increase perceived value and reduce churn. Customers are less likely to leave if they feel the package is designed specifically for them.

**Promotional Trials:** 

Offering free trials of services like device protection or tech support can showcase the benefits and create habits of use, making customers more reluctant to give them up.
